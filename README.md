## Get started

Open `sbt` and run the benchmarks with the `run` command of every project.
For example,

    > richardsJS/run

To test the fullOpt version, use, as usual:

    > set scalaJSStage in Global := FullOptStage

The benchmarks cross-compiled and can be run with the JVM too:

    > richardsJVM/run
